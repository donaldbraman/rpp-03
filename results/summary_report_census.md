# Geographic Policing Intensity Analysis - Updated with Census Data

## Executive Summary
Analysis using actual census population data reveals significant disparities in policing intensity across neighborhoods.

## Key Findings

### Population Distribution (Census-Based)
- **Ultra-Policed**: 6.6% of population (27,502 people)
- **Highly Policed**: 15.4% of population (63,887 people)
- **Normally Policed**: 77.9% of population (322,353 people)

### Arrest Rates per 1,000 Population
- **Ultra-Policed**: 813.5 total, 349.0 discretionary
- **Highly Policed**: 333.8 total, 140.0 discretionary
- **Normally Policed**: 119.0 total, 42.9 discretionary

### Annual Arrest Risk
**Overall Population:**
- Ultra-Policed: 1.96% (1 in 51)
- Normally Policed: 0.37% (1 in 271)
- **Disparity: 5.3x**

**Young Men (18-35):**
- Ultra-Policed: 3.88% (1 in 26)
- Normally Policed: 0.71% (1 in 142)
- **Disparity: 5.5x**

### Drug Enforcement
- Total drug arrests: 24,822
- Unique individuals: 8,762
- Facing enhanced penalties (2+ arrests): 56.0%
- Facing mandatory minimums (3+ arrests): 35.3%

## Methodology
- Used actual census block group populations from American Community Survey
- Identified policing intensity using discretionary arrest rates
- Calculated per capita risks using unique individuals (not total arrests)
- Time period: 10.5 years of data

## Data Sources
- Census data: 259 block groups
- Total population: 413,742
- Total arrests: 144,645
- Unique individuals: 41,807
