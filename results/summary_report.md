# Geographic Policing Intensity Analysis - Summary Report

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines policing intensity patterns across 3 categories of neighborhoods, 
identifying significant disparities in arrest risks and enforcement patterns.

## Key Findings

### Population Distribution
- **Ultra-Policed**: 15.4% of population
- **Highly Policed**: 77.9% of population  
- **Normally Policed**: 6.7% of population

### Annual Arrest Risks - Overall Population
- **Ultra-Policed**: 0.18% annually
- **Highly Policed**: 0.17% annually
- **Normally Policed**: 0.17% annually

### Annual Arrest Risks - Young Men (18-35)
- **Ultra-Policed**: 0.40% annually
- **Highly Policed**: 0.39% annually
- **Normally Policed**: 0.36% annually

### Lifetime Arrest Probability - Young Men
By age 35, starting from age 18:
- **Ultra-Policed**: 6.5% will have been arrested
- **Highly Policed**: 6.4% will have been arrested
- **Normally Policed**: 6.0% will have been arrested

### Drug Enforcement Disparities
Annual drug arrests per 1,000 population:
- **Ultra-Policed**: 0.90 per 1,000
- **Highly Policed**: 0.83 per 1,000
- **Normally Policed**: 0.63 per 1,000

Under equal drug use assumption (10% of population):
- **Ultra-Policed**: 0.9% of drug users face arrest
- **Highly Policed**: 0.8% of drug users face arrest
- **Normally Policed**: 0.6% of drug users face arrest

## Disparity Ratios

- **Overall population**: Ultra-Policed residents face **1.1x** higher annual arrest risk
- **Young men**: Ultra-Policed young men face **1.1x** higher risk

## Methodology

This analysis follows a comprehensive 33-step methodology:
1. Geographic categorization using discretionary arrests
2. Population-based risk calculations using unique individuals
3. Multiple arrest and escalation analysis
4. Drug offense deep dive with equal use assumptions

## Data Source

- Total arrests analyzed: 144,645
- Unique individuals: 41,807
- Time period: ~10.5 years
- Geographic units: Census block groups
